# PassGene
Password Generator with prompts to select which characters, number, and symbols.

This project was a huge learning experience and definitely very new to me. Javascript is not my cup of tea, but I'm willing to learn how to make all the functions work together and figuring this new type of coding.

## Demo and sources

## Installation
- To install this code, make sure you download the zip file, or clone the GitHub repository.

## Features 
- HTML, with basic inputs with buttons, all with divs and ids.
- CSS, very simple layout with media queries.
- JS, varibles with functions and else if statements.

## How does this work?
- Simply clicking on the Generate Password button and prompts will appear.
- Prompts will appear if you want upper or lower case letters first.
- Then you'll be asked if you want numbers or symbols in the generated password.
- Or simply choose all of them for a more secure password.

## What did I learn from all of this?
- How to properly use functions and variables.
- Using Click functions.
- Correct sequence for script.js
